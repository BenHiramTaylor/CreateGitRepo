This Application i made out of boredom is a little weekend project for me to work on to allow automation of my git repo creation.

When running this script, execute it with an argument of the new project name, for example: "python3 Create.py NewProject" - I have added that code to a bash function in my terminal so i can call NewGit Project from anywhere and it will execute the function.
